# Color-Coded
Game Systems and Design (ICS 61) Class Project

Color Coded was the final project of my 2014 Freshman class, ICS 61 - "Game Systems and Design" taught by professor Jain Ramesh at UC Irvine.  I worked with two other classmates: Mingxin (Candice) Ou and Han (Michael) Mei.

The game was written solely in Pyhon using the PyGame library.

The project was an assignment to create a game that would encourage players to exercise, with their activity measured through an app created for Android by the professor's teaching assistants.  Other than that requirement, all other game mechanics, aesthetics, and story were fully in the hands of the students.  Most of the code was written by me, along with some help and suggestions from Mingxin (Candice).

The game uses the Q, W, E, R, F buttons and arrow keys to play.  The game is an endless horde game that iterates through 1 to 10 enemies every 10 waves.  Every 10th wave spawns faster enemies, and the goal of the game is to shoot colored enemies with a similar colored projectile.
